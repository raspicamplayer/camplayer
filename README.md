# Camplayer - IP Camera viewer for the Raspberry Pi
Use your Raspberry Pi as advanced IP camera viewer.
The list of supported IP cameras is endless as Camplayer makes use of the RTSP and HTTP protocols for streaming.
Especially the RTSP protocol is supported by nearly all big brands out there.

 A picture is worth a thousand words.

## How many windows in grid view mode?

The maximum number of windows/video players in grid view mode depends on many factors  
including display resolution, video resolution, framerate, codec, Pi hardware etc.  

The tables below give you an idea of what to expect with some common video resolutions.  

### Single display 1920x1080@60Hz  

|                             | Raspberry Pi Zero | Raspberry Pi 2 | Raspberry Pi 3/3+ | Raspberry Pi 4 |
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|
| H264 640x360@24FPS          | ?                 | ?              | 9                 | 9              |
| H264 854x480@24FPS          | ?                 | ?              | 7                 | 7              |
| H264 1280x720@24FPS         | ?                 | ?              | 4                 | 4              |
| H264 1920x1080@24FPS        | 1                 | 1              | 1                 | 1              |

### Dual display 1920x1080@60Hz

|                             | Raspberry Pi Zero | Raspberry Pi 2 | Raspberry Pi 3/3+ | Raspberry Pi 4 |
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|
| H264 640x360@24FPS          | N/A               | N/A            | N/A               | 4 + 6          |
| H264 854x480@24FPS          | N/A               | N/A            | N/A               | 1 + 6          |


You can easely perform your own performance tests by running one of the test configs.

```
camplayer -c ../tests/test-performance_360pH264-config.ini
```

## Security warnings

* Password protected HTTP and RTSP streams are widely used on security cameras but are not 100% secure as these streams are still unencrypted. 
The only thing that is protected here is the login procedure.
* Anyone with physical access to your Raspberry Pi and/or SD card can potentially retrieve your IP camera credentials.
Passwords and usernames are saved as plain text.
* It's better to disable SSH or at least change the default password.

Therefore, please don't use this software if security is critical for you.
I take no responsibility for leaked footage, leaked credentials, hacked cameras etc., you have been warned!

## Installation

The instruction below assume you are running a recent Raspberry Pi OS Lite build.  
If you are interested in a plug & play system with some additional features, check out [https://www.rpi-camplayer.com/](https://www.rpi-camplayer.com/)

Add the following lines to '/boot/config.txt':  
```
gpu_mem=256
disable_overscan=1
```

Comment out (or delete) the following line in '/boot/config.txt' and reboot:  
```
# dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
```

Install git client:  
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

Get the source code and check it out in the current directory:  
```
git clone -b Camplayer_1.0 https://github.com/raspicamplayer/camplayer.git
```

Install camplayer by running the install script:  
```
sudo sh ./camplayer/install.sh
```

Now you can test your install with:  
```
camplayer --demo
```

After you finished your configuration (see next section), you can start camplayer with:  
```
sudo systemctl start camplayer.service
```

To automatically start camplayer at boot:  
```
sudo systemctl enable camplayer.service
```

To stop camplayer:  
```
sudo systemctl stop camplayer.service
```
or  
Press "q" key.

## Experimental HEVC/H265 support
You have to install an experimental VLC media player version,  
please follow the instructions of the following thread.  
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=257395  
  
It is important to note that VLC does not support windowed playback at the moment, so you can not create a grid layout of HEVC/H265 streams.
Once VLC supports this, I will probably drop OMXplayer support and rewrite the windowmanager code in a less hackish way.

## Configuration
### Getting started 
Create and open following file (assumes you are running as user 'pi')  
```
/home/pi/.camplayer/config.ini
```

Create device section(s).  

```ini
[DEVICE1]
channel1_name = optional OSD name
channel1.1_url = your 1st IP camera stream URL (main stream)
channel1.2_url = your 1st IP camera stream URL (sub stream)

[DEVICE2]
channel1_name = optional OSD name
channel1.1_url = your 2nd IP camera stream URL (main stream)
channel1.2_url = your 2nd IP camera stream URL (sub stream)
```
It is important that device sections are named "**[DEVICEx]**" and channels are named "**channelx.y_url**".  
At least 1 sub-channel must be added, up to 9 sub-channels are possible.

Create screen section(s)

```ini
[SCREEN1]
layout = 4
window1 = device1,channel1
window2 = device1,channel1
window3 = device2,channel1
window4 = device2,channel1
```
It is important that screen sections are named "**[SCREENx]**" and windows are named "**windowx**".  
The window values should be formatted as "**devicex,channelx**" and match the desired device section and channel you created in previous step.  
  
Another important point is that "**layout**" must be one of the following numbers "**1,4,6,7,8,9,10,13,16***"  
This number defines the layout and the number of windows per screen e.g. a layout of "6" gives you the following layout:  
https://github.com/raspicamplayer/camplayer/blob/master/resources/backgrounds/nolink_1P5.png  
  
You can find an overview of possible layouts here:  
https://github.com/raspicamplayer/camplayer/tree/master/resources/backgrounds

### Raspberry Pi dual display
First of all, camplayer assumes that both displays are set to the same resolution. So please verify this and if nessesary adjust your display configuration.
Now, to display a screen on the second HDMI (HDMI1), you have to add a 'display = 2' property to the desired SCREEN section.  

```ini
[SCREEN1]
display = 2
layout = 4
window1 = device1,channel1
...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Check logging output

To be sure all instances are stopped:  
```
sudo systemctl stop camplayer.service
```

Run camplayer from command line without 'sudo':  
```
camplayer
```

Check the output of this command for errors and/or warnings.  
  
* For the Raspberry pi 4, use the HDMI0 labeled output
* Unsupported hardware? -> see 'hardwarecheck' in advanced settings, no guarantee!
* H265/HEVC streams are not supported in grid mode!  

## Performance impact

You can experience HDMI signal dropouts and/or video artifacts when your configuration exeeds the capabilities of your Raspberry Pi's GPU.
It is hard to predict this in advance as it depends on many factors like.

* Video resolution and framerate
* Display resolution
* GPU/H264 decoder clock frequency
* Number of connected displays
* Background mode (advanced setting)
* Screen downscaling (advanced setting)
* Video OSD (advanced setting)

When in trouble, you can reduce the number of windows in the gridview to reduce the performance impact.  
Other options you can try are:  

* Set advanced setting "streamquality" to "0" (lowest quality)
* Set advanced setting "backgroundmode" to "0" (black background)
* Set advanced setting "screenchangeover" to "0" (normal changeover)
* Don't set advanced setting "screendownscale"
* Don't set advanced setting "enablevideoosd"
* Use a faster/newer Raspberry Pi model
* Reduce resolution/framerate inside your IP camera configuration
* Scaling the video resolution to the window resolution comes at a cost, a perfect match is preferred.  
You can achieve this by chosing your IP camera and/or display resolution carefully.  
Important to note, upscaling is still better than downscaling performance wise.  

## Advanced settings

You can change advanced settings by adding an "ADVANCED" section to your configuration file.  
In this example we set the video buffertime to 1000ms.

### Example
```ini
[ADVANCED]
buffertime = 1000
```

quit sequence       Left down; Right down; Left release; Right release
```

## Roadmap
### Camplayer 2
* Improve VLC and drop OMXplayer support, drop code hacks introduced to support them both.
* Proper windowed H265/HEVC playback, related to previous point.
* PTZ support by calling external scripts.
* Proper audio support.
